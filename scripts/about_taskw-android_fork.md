### About the [timew-android](https://github.com/linuxcaffe/timew-android) fork;
It is intended to adapt [ATimeTracker](https://github.com/netmackan/ATimeTracker) as an android front-end for [timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/), first, by providing script(s) to convert exported csv to timewarrior data, eventually, by converting the back-end to timewarrior-native data.
